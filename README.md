  Using the excel Application [download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng)
-  ## CHALLENGES
 ---
 **VLOOKUP** was a bit complex but after giving it my undivided attention and asking more questions about it , i was able to dichotomize
 ## STRUCTURES OF DATA
 ---
 I learned three Structures of Data
 - Structured Data
 - Semi Structured Data
 - Unstructured Data
### 1. STRUCTURED DATA:
---
 These are data that are seperated and arranged in a tabular form 
- Examples:
  
 |NAME|GENDER|AGE|MARITAL STATUS|
 |----|------|---|--------------|
 |David|Male|21|Single|
 |Dice|Male|12|Married|
 |Success|Female|18|Divorced|
 |Becca|Female|20|Married|
 |Gods'time|Male|22|Single|

 ### 2. SEMI STRUCTURED DATA:
 ---
 These are data that are seperated by symbols, they are not neccesary in a Tabular format
-  Example:
-  NAME, GENDER, AGE, MARITAL STATUS
-  David, Male, 21, Single
-  Dice, Male, 12, Married
-  Success, Female, 18, Divorced
-  Becca, Female, 20, Married
-  God'stime, Male, 22, Single
